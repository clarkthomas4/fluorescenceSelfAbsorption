An iterative self-absorption correction algorithm for 3D ptycho-fluorescence imaging

##### TODO
- [x] Remove hard coded file paths
- [ ] Simplify (single json parameter file)
- [ ] Create database for elements
- [ ] Implement detector coverage angle
- [ ] Optimise execution speed
- [ ] Complete re-emission implementation
- [ ] Noise removal by air region selection?
